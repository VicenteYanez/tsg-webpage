# Frequently Asked Questions
## **What is Magnetotellurics (MT) used for?**

Magnetotellurics is a passive geophysical technique that harnesses natural variations in the Earth’s electromagnetic field to map subsurface electrical conductivity.


### **Its key applications are**

| Hydrocarbon, mineral and groundwater exploration | Geothermal resource assessment               |
| Tectonic and structural imaging                  | Volcanology and geothermal‑hazard monitoring |



Because MT can image from a few hundred metres to several tens of kilometres depth, it uniquely reveals large‑scale geological structures that are out of reach for conventional seismic or drilling methods.

## **What are the main features of the software?**

We are building MTSur, a cloud‑based 3D MT modelling platform delivered as a Software‑as‑a‑Service (SaaS) solution. Users will be able to:

- Upload data and request a modelling run at a quoted price.
- Visualise results directly in the web interface and download them instantly.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing workflows thanks to fully compatible input‑output formats used by today’s leading MT modelling packages.

Outputs per run include:
- Model parameters (plain‑text files)
- Inversion settings (plain‑text files)
- High‑resolution visualisations (JPEG/PNG)

Planned modelling capabilities
- Full frequency coverage—from AMT to broadband measurements
- Meshes supporting > 1 million cells
- Topography‑aware models
- Multi‑solution exploration with quantitative uncertainty estimates
- Turn‑around times of 10 – 24 hours per job
- Optional “full‑service” offering: you provide the raw data and we handle mesh generation, hyper‑parameter tuning, and execution.

## **How will the service work?**

Pilot phase (today) – The workflow is manual. Please contact us at info@tsgeophysics.cl to discuss your project and obtain a quote.

Closed‑beta & commercial launch – Interested users will receive login credentials through our sales portal (currently under development). Once logged in you can:
- Upload and visualise your MT dataset.
- Submit a modelling request (price shown before submission).
- Track progress; results become available within 10‑24 hours.
- View and download the outputs directly from the dashboard.

## **Launch roadmap**
- Q4 2025 – Pilot testing of the core technology.
- Q3 2026 – Closed beta of the MTSur platform.
- Q4 2026 – Full commercial launch for all customers.

## **How much will the service cost?**
Pricing is being refined with a dynamic calculator that considers mesh size, number of stations, and frequency bands. Because our solution runs on highly efficient GPU‑accelerated infrastructure, we anticipate very competitive rates compared with traditional HPC‑based MT modelling services. Exact pricing will be provided during the quotation stage.

## **Got another question?**
